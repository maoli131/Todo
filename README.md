# To-Do List React

This project is a web based todo list. User can add/edit/delete events to be finished.
It originates from react-todo tutorial by [Xiqiang Lin](https://github.com/xiqianglin/react-todo) and ["Create a Simple To Do List"](https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-todo-app-in-react-9bd29054566b) tutorial. It serves as a hand-on project for me
to learn react. This project will be extended to more functionality and deployed via AWS. (hopefully)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
